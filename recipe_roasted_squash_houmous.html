<h1>Roasted Squash Houmous</h1>

<div></div>




<h1>Ingredients</h1>




<ul>

<li>1 butternut squash, about 850g,
peeled, deseeded and cubed</li>

<li>2 garlic cloves, bashed</li>

<li>3cm piece of fresh root ginger,
peeled and finely chopped</li>

<li>Olive oil</li>

<li>1 tbsp tahini</li>

<li>1 x 400g tin chickpeas, drained
and rinsed</li>

<li>Juice of ½ lemon</li>

<li>Sea salt and freshly ground black
pepper</li>

<li>Warmed or griddled pitta bread or
flatbread, to serve</li>

</ul>





<h2>For the ras el hanout spice blend</h2>

<ul>

<li>1 cinnamon stick</li>

<li>1 tsp clove</li>

<li>1 tbsp coriander seeds</li>

<li>½ tbsp fenugreek seeds</li>

<li>½ tbsp fennel seeds</li>

<li>1 tbsp mustard seeds</li>

<li>½ tbsp cumin seeds</li>

<li>1 tsp paprika</li>

</ul>



<div></div>



<h2>Method</h2>



<ul>

<li>First make the ras el hanout spice blend. Break the cinnamon stick
into pieces. Place in a dry pan with the cloves and seeds, and toast
over a medium heat for about 1 minute until aromatic and the
seeds are popping(shake the spices in the pan as you heat them to
prevent them from burning).</li>

<li>Once toasted, remove from the heat, and add the paprika. Place
in a spice grinder, blender or mortar and grind until the mixture is a
powder – sift it if necessary. This spice blend will keep for up to 3
months if stored in an airtight container.</li>

<li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/Gas 4.</li>

<li>Make the houmous. In a large bowl mix the cubed squash, garlic
cloves and ginger with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon
of the spice mix. Season with salt and pepper and scatter in a
single layer in a roasting tray. Place in the preheated oven and
cook for 30 minutes until tender all the way through.</li>

<li>Once the squash is soft, add the contents of the tray to a blender,
discarding the garlic skins. Add the tahini, chickpeas and a
squeeze of lemon juice along with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Blend
until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary – you
might need some extra lemon juice.</li>

<li>Transfer the houmous to a bowl and sprinkle with a little of the spice
mix. Drizzle with olive oil and serve with warmed or griddled pitta
bread on the side.</li>

</ul>
